Introduction

Punishment Process

When a report is received and investigated, the RD High Command or DoO Class - Os will reference the infractions with this document, adding up the points for the laws broken, and using the table at the bottom of this document, the highest possible punishment will be decided. The RD High Command or DoO Class - Os will use this as a baseline, and will either give out the punishment mandated in the table, make the punishment less severe based on the context of the situation, or decide that a punishment should not be issued at all due to lack of evidence or other reasons.

Any punishment may be altered by the Regulations Department Directorate or the Department of Operations Directorate should they see a case to be deserving of something outside the suggested punishment. (Example: Permanent C-E)


















Expectations


Discussions

Each and every punishment request and/or investigation conclusion must be discussed thoroughly by the RD High Command, who must reach a consensus to decide on an agreed punishment issue, using this document on a baseline.


Discussions on punishments are confidential, and are not for public release.
The majority of the RD High Command must be in full agreement and reach a stable consensus before issuing said punishment to the infractor, or they may decide to not issue a punishment at all based on the given evidence.

Appeals

If an infractor believes that their punishment was unfair, wrongly issued, or that they should have received a different punishment, they may submit an appeal to have their punishment removed (or reduced if a Class-E). They will do this using the #appeals channel in the RD Public Discord. If they are banned from the server, they may use someone else as a medium or DM a member of the RD Directorate. The situation and case will be reassessed, and a final verdict will be made. If the punishment is a 2 week CE or less, only one appeal may be made. If the punishment is a permanent Class-E, an appeal may be made immediately after the issuing if they feel that they shouldn’t have received the punishment, however if appealing to have your punishment reduced, the infractor must wait at least a month before appealing for the first time, and all appeals after that can only be filed once every forty five (45) days.
Punishment Issuing

When a punishment has been decided on, a member of the Regulations Department Directorate or DoO C-O will issue the punishment, unless it is a formal warning or a reminder, then any member of the RD High Command may issue the punishment.  If the punishment is a Class-E, they will make a card on the Class-E Board Trello using the format, rank the infractor Class-E in the group, and inform the infractor of the sentence. If it is a formal warning/reminder, the RD High Command member will simply contact the infractor and inform them, and log the warning/reminder for future use.
If the infractor is given a Class-E sentence, the command of any departments they are in shall be informed and are expected to demote the infractor to the lowest rank possible for the duration of the Class-E sentence.

















Modes of Infractions


Multiple Infractions 

Corporation Members who break more than one law, may be faced with multiple law infraction punishments, which may be stacked on each other depending on the severity of a case. When this happens, the punishment points will simply be added together to reach a conclusion on a punishment.



Repeated Infractions

When an infraction is repeated or someone breaks more than one rule in a certain period of time, their past disciplinary record is evaluated, including warnings, reminders, past Class-E sentences, and sometimes departmental punishments.


All infractors will have their disciplinary record taken into consideration when their final punishment is being decided on, although usually repeated infractions will have their punishment points multiplied by 1.5 or 2, depending on the circumstances.


Special Cases


It is to be noted that infractors are NOT restricted to Class-Es as a form of punishment. Infractors may also receive clearance demotions, however, these are only an option for repeated offenders, or serious offenses like going rogue, or where the punishments are 1 or 2 week Class-Es. That being said, demotions shall only become an option in cases where:
The person has several infractions. (3+)
The person has many repeated infractions of the same law. (3+)
The person is explicitly being malicious.
The person has committed a very serious infraction.
The issuer is a member of the Overwatch or is the Administrator, and they have deemed a clearance demotion to be suitable.

Permanent Class-Es are only an option when one of these conditions is true:
The person has gone rogue, and has caused severe damage. For example, destroying vehicles, killing personnel, breaching entities, etc.
The person has broken several infractions at once. (4+)
The issuer is a member of the Overwatch or is the Administrator, and they have deemed a permanent Class-E to be suitable.

Permanent Class-Es will always need the RD/DoO Overseer or the Administrator’s approval, unless the subject has gone explicitly rogue (meaning that there is enough evidence to back it up without needing an investigation).

If a minor fraction is committed by someone who is on a department team, the punishment shall be handled by the infractor’s department HRs. Major infractions (3.5 points+) will still be handled by RD and the infractor’s department HRs.
Members of TAG are exempt in some cases, for example, if they are ordered to kill someone, they may kill that person and they will not receive any punishment for it.

Any reports against TAG members whilst on duty will be handled by the RD directorate as well as TAG HRs to ensure punishments against them are issued correctly.
