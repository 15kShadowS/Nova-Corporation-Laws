ED is the only department permitted to order drinks from E-004 unless the cafeteria is set to open, in which any departmental member may order Grey TL drinks. Green and Yellow TL drinks may only be ordered by SC with authorization from SC command during emergency situations (such as a raid, or a large-scale riot) or for TAG via their VIP, and Red+ TL drinks may only be ordered for testing purposes. For reference on the levels of drinks, read Entity 004 Output List

### Super Soldier Regulations
“Super Soldier” is a term used to define an individual who has multiple anomalous effects on them and/or is utilizing anomalous gear to further their advantage in combat. Due to the nature of how many variants there are, and the constant growing nature of these combinations, the specific combinations in question will be kept to the eyes of the proper authorized personnel, mainly SC and ID.

* For any reason that a combative is to utilize entities/anomalous gear for the purpose of “Super Soldier", are they to properly relay such information to RD for logging purposes, as to ensure no abuse of permissions takes place.
