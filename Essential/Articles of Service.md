# **Article 1: The Nova Corporation**

## **Section 1: Prose**
> The Nova Corporation: where seriousness goes to die. These Articles got the thumbs-up from the Class - X Overlords, but let's face it, they're about as useful as a chocolate teapot. 

### **Definitions**
**Class - X Overlords:** The super-duper high-ups who think they're the guardians of the galaxy or something. They're the ones who think they're so important they sneeze glitter.

**Department:** Think of them as the cool kids' club, but with more paperwork and less fun. Led by Class-O bigwigs who probably think they're hot stuff.

**Entity:** Anything weirder than a three-eyed frog on a pogo stick. The Nova Corporation catches these oddballs for science, or maybe just to mess with them.

**Site Overwatch:** The minions who watch from the shadows, probably doodling on their notepads.

**Threat Level:** A rainbow scale of panic, from "Hey, that's weird" to "Holy guacamole, we're doomed!"

### **Clarification**
**Corporation Goofs:** Everyone from D to O, from the office prankster to the guy who thinks he's the boss's favorite.

**Innovation Nutters:** The mad scientists cooking up stuff that's either genius or just plain bonkers.

**Operations Goofballs:** The folks keeping the lights on and the coffee brewing, but mostly just goofing off.

**Regulations Whizzes:** The rule-sticklers who think they're the kings and queens of orderliness.

**Security Silly-Billies:** The defenders of the rubber chicken stash, armed with nothing but enthusiasm.

**Engineering Whackos:** The brains behind the madness, building stuff that's either groundbreaking or just plain weird.

**Engineering Property:** All the toys and gadgets the engineering team plays with, like a giant slinky or a toaster that also tells jokes.

## **Section 2: Base Law**
> Universal Corporation Legislation: because apparently, someone thought we needed rules for our rules.

1) **CLEARANCE LEVELS:

*a) Classification - X:** The big shots who think they're the kings of the castle. Nobody messes with them, or they'll have to answer to the sparkly sneezes.*

*b) Classification - O:** The second-highest rank, where you get all the perks but none of the glory. They're like the sidekicks, but without the cool costume.*

*c) Classification - A:** The highest rank without the boring paperwork. Basically, they're the ones who get all the credit without doing any of the work.*

*d) Anyone from D to B:** No special treatment here, folks. Just more work and less fun.*

2) **INFORMATION RESTRICTIONS:
   
*a) Everyone can see Nova Corporation stuff, unless we say they can't:*

*i) If it's super-secret, we keep it under lock and key, like the recipe for the world's worst lasagna.*

*ii) If the big shots say you can see it, you can see it, even if it's about how many marshmallows fit in the break room toaster.*

*iii) Sometimes we hide stuff just for kicks, like where we keep the emergency supply of glitter.*

3) **CLASSIFICATION - E RANK:
   
*a) If you mess up, you get a new rank: Class - E for "Extra Silly." Congratulations, you played yourself.*

4) **JURISDICTION OF ARTICLE 2:
   
*a) Our rules only count on the company Slack channel, not on your secret TikTok account.*

5) **HIGH COMMAND RANKS WITHIN EACH DEPARTMENT:

*a) Operations Department:** Folks are ranked from "Drone" to "Office Gopher," because someone's gotta do the grunt work.*

*b) Regulations Department:** From "Chief Stickler" to "Queen of Red Tape," making sure everyone fills out their TPS reports in triplicate.*

*c) Innovation Department:** Ranging from "Head Idea Generator" to "Chief Mad Scientist," because you can never have too many ideas.*

*d) Security Corps:** From "Security Muscle" to "Guardian of the Rubber Chickens," protecting our precious stash.*

*e) Engineering Department:** From "Widget Maker" to "Master of the Rubber Duckies," because who else is gonna build the giant slinky?*

6) **DIRECTORATE RANKS WITHIN EACH DEPARTMENT:

*a) Operations:** Goes from “Class - X Commandant” to “Executive Pencil Pusher,” because even bosses have to start somewhere.*

*b) Regulations:** Ranges from "Overseer" to "Assistant Director of Bureaucracy," because someone's gotta keep the paperwork flowing.*

*c) Innovation:** From "Idea Guru" to "Assistant Director of Shenanigans," because every great invention starts with a little chaos.*

*d) Security Corps:** From "General" to "Commander of the Rubber Chicken Brigade," because someone's gotta keep the office pranks in check.*

*e) Engineering Department:** From "Chief Tinkerer" to “Assistant Director of Whimsy,” because someone's gotta keep the giant slinky in line.*

7) **FOREIGN PERSONNEL:

*a) VIPs, because apparently, we're fancy like that. They can tag along with our "Task Force Detachment of Fun" if they promise not to break anything.*

8) **DEPARTMENTAL GUIDELINES EXEMPTIONS:

*a) Sometimes you gotta bend the rules to get stuff done, like wearing a clown nose on Casual Friday.*

9) **RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT PUNISHMENTS:

*a) Everyone can ask what they did wrong, but we might just tell you to go take a hike.*

*b

) If you ask nicely, we'll spill the beans, but don't expect us to clean up the mess.*

*c) Some secrets are like that time we accidentally turned the break room into a bounce house: better left forgotten.*

*d) If you're in trouble, we'll point you in the right direction, but don't expect a pat on the back.*

*e) Sometimes we gotta redact stuff, like when Bob accidentally sent out an email that said... nevermind.*

Article 4: Tweaking the Rule Book

1) Once everyone agrees on what's written in Article 5, the Regulation guys can fiddle with the rule book, but they have to follow some rules themselves, which they'll figure out later.

2) After everyone says "Yeah, that's okay," in Article 5, only certain people can change their signatures, but they need permission first, which also needs permission.

3) If the Regulation folks vote yes, they can change any rule except the ones under Article 3. But why Article 3 gets special treatment, nobody knows.

4) If the Regulation folks and the department bosses give the thumbs up, they can change the rules in Article 3, but they all have to agree first, even though they might not even understand what they're agreeing to.

a) Some rules under Article 3 need everyone to say "Sure, go ahead" before they can be changed. Why? Who knows.

5) If the big shots say so, they can change any rule, just because.

Article 5: Signing on the Dotted Line

Once the big brains in the Regulations Department finish doodling with the rule book, they hand it over for a group review to make sure it still makes some sense compared to the last rule book.

To officially stamp the rule book, we need signatures from the big shots representing each department, and if there are any even bigger shots overseeing them, they need to scribble their approval too. Plus, a bunch of other important folks can add their autographs just for good measure.
