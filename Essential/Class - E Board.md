## Class - E Board  
### About  
The **Class - E** board is used to keep track of all Class - E personnel within the Corporation.  

The **Class - E** is a punishment rank given to those who break the law and are punished for it.  

Only members of the **Class - X** Overwatch, **Regulations Department Class - Os** and **DoO Class - Os** are allowed in the **Class - E** board. Class - E requests should run through the **Regulations Department**.  

### Procedure  
All personnel are allowed to request a Class - E by placing a card for it in the **Pending** list.  

The following template is to be used:  
`**Departmental Ranks:** `  
`**Broken Laws:** `  
`**Proof of Offense:** `  

The name of the card must be ``USERNAME | CORPORATION CLASS``  

The only personnel allowed to approve a request are **Regulations Department Class - Os**, **Class - Xs**, **DoO Class - Os** and **The Administrator**.  

The duration of the Class - E is established by viewing the Law Infraction Punishments law. A **Due Date** is to be added by the approver to the date retrieved from adding the duration to the date of the Class - E.  
Once the Due Date is due, the Class - Ed member is to have their original rank re-established.  
The approver of the Class - E is to DM the Class - Ed if possible, linking the card to their Class - E, when the Class - E will end, and who Class - Ed.  

Alternatively, a Class - E may also be rejected. Rejected Class - E requests are to be put at the **Rejected** list.
