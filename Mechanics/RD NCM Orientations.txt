Introduction

Description and Purpose

NCM Orientations are a way for RD personnel to relay information to NCMs so they may understand the Legislation, AoS, better. 
Within these Orientations, NCMs are introduced to the AoS, given a brief teaching over its content, and allowed questions about the AoS.
The goal of these Orientations is to spread knowledge of the AoS in order to curb legislative infractions among Corporation Members on-site or otherwise.

Beginning of the Event

The host will first gather several, willing NCMs to participate in the Orientation. Once they have begun the event, they will direct all attendees towards the AoS document that is in the Discord server so they may refer to it as needed during the Orientation. If they do not have Discord or cannot access it at the time, they may continue to participate. Do not remove them from the orientation. Once all applicable attendees have done so, the host will relay the following (Or similar); 
“We are now going to begin the Orientation over the AoS. I will be giving all of you a brief summary over each Article and any important sections.”

At no point will the host become impatient or hostile towards attendees. If there is an attendee who is “trolling” or ruining the event, they may be removed Professionally.

These individuals should be for C-D, however spectators from C-C+ may attend to refresh information
