The Class - O rank is the highest rank below Class - X, and holds multiple responsibilities and duties.  

That being said, it is important that promotions to said clearance are passed through the Class - X Overwatch as a rank proposal.  

Class - O inductions may only happen if enforced by the Administrator or if passed by the Overwatch.  

Class - O demotions may only happen if enforced by the Administrator, passed by the Overwatch or in emergency scenario. (if said Class - O goes rogue, for example, it is considered an emergency scenario, and may therefore be demoted and then logged for the motive of demotion)  

Class - Os hold the following responsibilities:  
 **-** Permanent loyalty to the Corporation until termination of spot (either by resignation or demotion)  
 **-** Reading applications  
 **-** Moderating the discord server and the games  
 **-** Following all rules and being a role model member of the community  
 **-** Maintaining maturity and grammar in Corporation- related spaces with the exception of off-topic and unrelated spaces.  

Class - Os must be added to their respective Class - O clearance trellos upon induction (Class - E Board, for example) and removed if demoted.  

Class - Os must be notified of their induction and/or demotion by the Class - X responsible for such action.
